# Tidy UCI HAR Data

This project contains a script that can be used to create a "tidy" data set from raw data collected from 

The raw data from which we create a tidy data set can be found here:  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

### Running the script

The project contains a file called run_analysis.R that creates the tidy data from the raw dataset.
The run_analysis script must be run from the same directory containing the unzipped raw data from the link given above.
After checking our the repository of this project and unzipping the data in the same directory, a "dir" or "ls" run at the command line should show the following files/directories:
* README.md
* run_analysis.R  (file)
* UCI HAR Dataset (directory)
